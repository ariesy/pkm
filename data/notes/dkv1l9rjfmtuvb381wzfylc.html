<p>Nothing special, just create two different CNAME records, and both points to [username].github.io.</p>
<p>For example, the first github pages project is [username].github.com/project-a, and it's published at [username].github.io.(The first github pages site will be published at root). You can create a custom domain CNAME record like project-a and point to <strong>[username].github.io</strong>. Then you can create the second github pages project at [username].github.com/project-b, and it will be published to [username].github.io/project-b. The trick here is that you only need to create another CNAME record like project-b and still point to <strong>[username].github.io</strong>. Now you have two github pages sites <strong>project-a.[you-domain].com</strong> and <strong>project-b.[your-domain].com</strong>.</p>
